# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

Friend Finder is a Node and Express based friend compatibility application. Users are matched by comparing their survey answers with answers from other users.

4. Your `apiRoutes.js` file should contain two routes:

   * A GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
   * A POST routes `/api/friends`. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.

6. Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

   * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   * With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     * Example:
       * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
   * Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on.
   * The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

7. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match as a model pop-up.
